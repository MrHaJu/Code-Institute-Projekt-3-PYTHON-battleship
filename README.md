  ## User Experience (UX)

### Initial discussion
In project 3 I programmed a game called "Battleship".
The game is a simple PVE game. The player and the computer have 10 moves to win the game. The winner is the one who either hits all enemy ships or has the higher score at the end.

### User stories

#### Client goals

- The user should be able to play the game without any prior knowledge of the game

#### First-time visitor goals
* I want to find out how the game works
* I want to win against the computer
* I want to be able to exit the game when I don't want to play anymore

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* I want to win against the computer
* I want to be able to exit the game when I don't want to play anymore

## Design

The game was programmed in Python to use the terminal. Since the game is text based, it has no real design
